# Automate

My name is Manicdesigner here, I wanna be some form of web developer in the future. I just do not know where I fit in.
So while I figure out where I fit in. I have been watching 
"WEAREDEVELOPERS" videos on Youtube. They are very solid looks at your style, your technique, the way you think, the tools you feel are important. 

## What Is Important

I was watching one video, and the speaker repeated more than once, 
> We Are Developers!
> So Why are we doing things we can automate? no time, not enough time to look at stack overflow?, Do not feels it matters?
After this he said 'of all the things that changed **Bash** has not. <br>
Now that spoke to me! Something I know the basics but nothing to do anything cool with, is an important and one of the first things we should _turn too_?

I read a lot of people are turning bash scripts into python scripts. Which makes me want to learn bash scripts more... So I can learn the understanding of what I would be converting to Python.

## What is Automate

Automate repository, is for any automation codes. I or anyone wants to donate that help us as developers do our work in one or more ways below.

- safer
- easier
- less redundant
- timely
- solves a problem
- helps people who are disabled / elderly
- reduces steps
- helps none technical people use it more
- get called to help less due to it.
- other **reasons** that _are_ **positive**.
- **is in the practice folder**.

## Organization

there are only going to be a few main folders, that 
does not mean it is not going to be organized as well as possible :). In my bio below I say I am learning bash as of now. So I will probably be heading the bash section. But This wont turn into an extraganza of craziness in not time of just files everywhere. Unless we start off cleanly.

### Folder Structure
 So we will have bash as the main.<br>
 inside Bash and all the other ones will be a
 'Gherkin' folder for '.feature' files so you can write out your ideas for everyone to see and if you get stuck. maybe someone can help based off these psuedo-code you written before you started with... which is far easier then a glob of none working code that is spaghetti'ed together....some 
 might want to just start over with that :/ .
 _Next_: There is a folder inside the named folders for _our_ scripts. 

```feature
      Feature put script into folder
      scenario when script is complete
         When "script is done in 'bash'"
         Then 'pull request to place in
         correct folder which would be
         bash/bash-shells'
```
